Miscellaneous C++ Library
=========================
This is just a simple library that I am currently writing to teach myself some more advanced concepts
in C++. It will start of simple data structures and we will see where I will go from there. I definitely
want to explore some of the newer feature of the newer C++ standards (i.e. C++11 and C++14), so my
code should reflect that accordingly.
